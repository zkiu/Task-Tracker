# Description

This project is the centre piece of Kiu's portfolio. This tracker is used to monitor more complex tasks than to-do-lists, but less complex than longer term 'project' like tasks. It will demonstrate Kiu's knowledge of the full web development stack, from the font-end to the back-end. The project uses React, and Node.js at the backend. Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Function, Hosting) will provide server services to this app.

The code for this is available at https://github.com/zkiu/.... The page can be accessed here https://zkiu.github.io/....
